Composable tools - not locked away in app silos

Breathless lens:

* What if we could add the snooze button to gmail ourselves?
* What is the GUI equivalent of Emacs, the tool that eats everything because it's so easy to mould?
* If spreadsheets are the 90% done UI for timeseries, what is the 90% UI for personal/group automation and organization?
* What if every problem is a view maintenance problem?

Feature lens:

* Structured data
* Queries/views with incremental maintenance
* Syncing/VCS
  * Essential for modern use - web, mobile etc
* GUI layer
* Default GUI components eg schema editors, data viewer, query builder
* Always debug mode

# Imp I

Same as previous version of imp, but:

* running on a webpage with a simple editor
* using rewrite rules so we don't totally explode on _
