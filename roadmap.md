All first-order language features. Fast enough to run simple data science examples on small datasets.

* ~~var~~
* ~~apply~~
* ~~abstract~~
* ~~and/or/not~~
* ~~==/forall/exists~~
* ~~negation~~
* ~~reduce~~
* ~~let~~
* ~~tuple~~
* ~~compose~~

Passes:

* ~~parsing~~
* ~~scoping~~
* ~~semantics~~
* ~~inference~~
* ~~lowering~~
* ~~DNF~~
* variable ordering (TODO need to reorder for native functions)
* ~~bounding~~
* ~~native functions~~

Tests/docs

* ~~basic feature tests~~
* 100% branch coverage
* tutorial notebook
* internals notebook
* kaggle notebook
